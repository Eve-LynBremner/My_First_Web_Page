                <h2>Freelance Data Project</h2>
                <h3>Company - Bespoke Jewellers in Surrey</h3> 
                <p> The Problem - Workshop Manager and Sales team manually logging job packets
                    into Google Spreadsheets. Resulting in input errors, invalid entries, and
                    a suboptimal reporting structure.</p>
                <p> The solution - Created an easy to use Job-Logging System in Google Sheets
                    that:</p>
                <!-- <ul> -->
                    <li>automatically inserts data into their log book</li>
                    <li>updates certain fields without requiring the user to open the log book</li>
                    <li>pulls up job info without having to search through the underlying data</li>
                    <li>enables a high standard of reporting</li>
                <!-- </ul> -->
                <p> Data validation was added to increase accuracy, a simple layout was used to make 
                    it user friendly. Processes were re-evaluated to ensure consistency, and 
                    additional fields were introduced to allow for more in depth and informative
                    reporting.</p>

                <h2>Personal Project</h2>
                <h3>Concept - Create an app for Wine Lovers</h3> 
                <p> I enjoy good wine, and have been to many wine farms sampling their ranges. The 
                    problem I have is trying to remember the different experiences I had and which wines 
                    I enjoyed most. That's when I came up with the idea to create an app that stores all this info.
                    The app allows users to:</p>
                        <li>log the wines they've tried and rate them</li>
                        <li>track the wine farms they've visited and leave notes and photos on their experiences</li>
                        <li>plan their next wine trip with discounts available from partners</li>
                        <li>access to competitions and exclusive wine clubs</li>
                        <li>linkt directly to wine farm websites and make enquiries</li>
                <p> Having all this in one app, is a game changer, for both wine lovers and wine farms. And there's 
                    plenty more upgrades that can be added to the app.</p>
